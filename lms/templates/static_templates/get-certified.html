        Because businesses need you.

    <p class="lead">
      They need experts who remain vendor neutral without getting tainted by vendor generated FUD and tease out the best possible solution to build out their cloud infrastructure within budget constraints.
      They need DevOps staff members who know how to migrate existing applications over to the cloud and automate cloud operations while minimizing business downtime.
      And they need people who can architect a robust cloud blueprint for the business.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      So are you the rock star of your niche where head hunters from Fortune 500 businesses are after you or hot startups trying to lure you? Do you have a full roster of awesome clients who are paying you top dollar? If you’re not there yet (or even if you are), you need to think carefully about how employers (or your clients) see you.

    <h2 align="center">
      There is a reason we call it <img src="/static/images/default-theme/logo.png" alt="Cloud Genius" id="reason">
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p class="lead">
      Why did we call it that? Because we’re inviting you to step up and be a Cloud Genius. It’s a plain fact. You know more than most other cloud professionals. You have a more advanced approach. You’ve invested in your own professional development. You “get” where cloud computing is headed — now and in the future. As a smart, tech-savvy person, you should be acknowledged as the Cloud Genius.
      Now we need to ensure employers/clients see you that way, too...

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Program Experience<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Cloud Genius certification requires hands-on experiential learning. The program requires considerable hands on work that you will do on your Windows or Mac computer on which you will run the Cloud Genius Workstation. That way your experimentation will not mess up your computer. Before meeting as scheduled every week, you review video lectures and learning material available on-demand. Our instructors do not lecture you in class, instead facilitate learning while you collaborate with others on real projects, discuss issues, and debate pros/cons of various approaches to identify the best solution for a problem at hand. Through this program, you gain a solid foundation in cloud technologies, modern DevOps practices including automation of cloud infrastructure using ruby and chef. Don’t worry if you don’t already know programming because we will teach you what it takes to accomplish the task. You will learn concepts, principles, and best practices driven architectural blueprints needed to manage & secure a modern cloud-enabled business.

      <p class="lead">
        Taking up the challenge of all of individual certificate courses opens up the door to Cloud Genius certification.

        Our certification program is just that … recognition for those who have demonstrated advanced ability.
        We wanted to be sure that our certification was meaningful, and not just a “piece of paper” that anyone can buy.

        To ensure that everyone holding the certification is a well-qualified professional, at the end of the course you’ll be eligible to apply for Cloud Genius Certification. You’ll submit a live and functional cloud project of your choice (we’ll let you know exactly how to do that) and our team will personally evaluate every application.

        You’ll need to demonstrate your ability to create at a professional level to win your certification. That’s a huge plus for you — it means the market will never be glutted with Certified Cloud Geniuses.
        <br/>

        Think of it like a college course: anyone can sign up for the course, but you’ll need to put the work in if you want to get credit for it.

        Once you’re approved, you’ll have a badge you can put on your website, as well as a Cloud Genius Certification you can show clients.

        Because of the time it takes to individually review every evaluation, applications will be processed first-come, first-served. The sooner you get started, the earlier you’ll be in the evaluation queue.

        <br/>
        We will only be processing 25 certification applications. To make sure you are in that initial group, don’t delay in getting signed up! Those who enroll after the initial 25 applicants will be placed on a waiting list. Every applicant will be reviewed — but if you want to start benefiting from certification as quickly as possible, you’ll need to get signed up early.

      <p class="lead">
        We’d like to challenge you to raise the stakes and bring your best game to this process. To spur that on, the very best among you — evaluated on talent, professionalism, and high-level strategic thinking — will be featured on a new “Recommended Cloud Genius” page.
        <br/>
        Inclusion on this page will be necessarily subjective, but it boils down to a simple but powerful “X Factor” — would we personally recommend you to a friend looking for help?
        <br/>
        If the answer is yes, we’ll feature you as one of our recommended Cloud Genius, along with a quick bio and your content specialty. This page will become a powerhouse directory of the “best of the best,” and a nearly effortless way for you to find the best opportunities.
        <br/>
        All Certified Cloud Genius will be eligible for the top tier program, and there will be no additional charge. It’s just our way of recognizing the best and helping you to get the word out.

<h2>Of course we have some bonuses …</h2>

<p class="lead">
Making the right connections is key to career growth and your membership helps you opens up a host of opportunities for you so you can connect with our hiring partner companies and showcase what you offer. And we reserve the right to get you some additional materials and member exclusive webinars focused on cloud computing. :) We’re planning on offering this course for a long time — and as long as you keep your certification current, you’ll have access to all of the course improvements and enhancements that we throw in later on.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  How long do you have access to your certification?
  <br/>
  Once you’ve joined the course and received your certification, you’ll remain certified as long as you’re a member in good standing of the community.
  <br/>

  (Because Cloud Genius Certification, after all, is your ongoing professional education. It’s what will keep you focused and aware of emerging trends or shifts in the marketplace.)
